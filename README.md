# Matplotlib - The Power of Plots

What good is data without a good plot to tell the story?

The project is to analyse the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

Python Matplotlib was used to manipulate and visualize the data and findings. 

The analysis used a complete data from two datasets in CSV format. Data set one was Mouse_metadata.csv and a Study_results.csv.
Both datasets were imported, merged,cleaned and the aggregate data diplayed in to Python Pandas dataframes and visualized in Matplotlib.
