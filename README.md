# The Power of Plots

What good is data without a good plot to tell the story?

So, let's take what you've learned about Python Matplotlib and apply it to a real-world situation and dataset:

Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.

The following:

* Check the data for duplicate mice and remove any data associated with that mouse ID.

* Generate a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.

* Generate a bar plot that shows  the number of mice per time point for each treatment regimen throughout the 
* Generate a pie plot that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.

* Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. 
* Calculate the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.

* Generate a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style.


* Generate a line plot of time point versus tumor volume for a single mouse treated with Capomulin.

* Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.

* Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment.
* Plot the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.
